(Done)Bugs: Termination error, running into multiple loop at the last action time -> happening due to the min function that chooses nearest action time
Bug2: Implement Delay
(Done) Autocancel only limit orders that leave top 2 levels upon inspread
(Done) Flag for wake up messages, boolean for market orders + inspread shifts
add noncontrollable randomagents non_gym

Todo:
implement custom parameters
